NOW:
1 -> Do the lexer:
    1) tokenize <- YOU'RE HERE (@ "lexer.c")
        a) Numeric tokens marked as U, L, LL, UL and ULL are currently not parsed correctly
        b) Tokens should be evaluated wherever possible
        c) Preprocessor definitions resolved by a call to the preprocessor before
    2) consolidate (convert unresolved tokens to resolved tokens)
2 -> Add insertion/erasure to "vector.h"

LATER:
1 -> Do the preprocessor
2 -> Compile line-by-line to assembly
3 -> Call nasm on each file
4 -> Link all files with ld
5 -> Attach file position to token for error formatting purposes
